# Malaria Classification - ML

This  project aims to develop a machine-learning solution for detecting malaria-infected cells from microscopic images. Utilizing a dataset of 27,558 images sourced from the NIH website, the project focuses on preprocessing, feature extraction, and model development using techniques like CNNs and transfer learning. The ultimate goal is to create a deployable tool that assists healthcare professionals in quickly and accurately diagnosing malaria, potentially saving lives. Contributions and collaboration are encouraged to further advance the field of medical image analysis.
